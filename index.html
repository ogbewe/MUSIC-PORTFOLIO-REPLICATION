            Hey! Welcome here. About me? You probably know all about me from
            listening to my music. Don't listen to my music? Well, this is a
            step in the right direction. My name is Walker Johnny, a RnB singer
            with the stage name "JohnnyB", I started singing since i was 5 years
            old, but i started singing officially in 2018. After my debut album
            Infinite (2019), I signed with Turner Beacons record and
            subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in late 2019 with
            Butterflies EP. I have since then released other music which
            includes Don't leave me, Love you Baby amongst others.
